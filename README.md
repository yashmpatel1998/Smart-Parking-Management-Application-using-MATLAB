# Smart-Parking-Management-Application-using-MATLAB

The main goal of the Application is to operate the automatic lifting bar with application, and it also shows the real time availability of parking spots. 
In this project, I used MATLAB GUI to create Smart Parking Management Application. ARDUINO UNO is used to control the components in the project. ThingSpeak cloud platform is used with MATLAB codes to store and visualize data in real time.
